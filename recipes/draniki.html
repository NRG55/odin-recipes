            <h2>Draniki recipe</h2>
            Draniki are considered to be a Belarusian dish. Draniki is a high-calorie dish 
            because the pancakes are fried in a lot of oil. 
            Traditionally the potato pancakes were served at breakfast garnished with deep 
            fried pork fat or salo.

            The main secret of delicious Draniki is to serve them hot. They have a very tender 
            taste and aroma which disappears after they were reheated. The potato pancakes are 
            traditionally served with sour cream, however there are many other sauces that go 
            well with the dish.
