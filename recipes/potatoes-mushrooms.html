            <h2>Potatoes fried with mushrooms recipe</h2>
            This simple dish can be quite different depending on the mushrooms you choose. 
            For example, noble white mushrooms have completely different taste here than oyster 
            mushrooms or champignons. But most of all people love potatoes fried with chanterelle
            mushrooms for their autumn hue and unique flavor. By the way it is much easier 
            to cook chanterelles than white mushrooms.

            Each of the dish ingredients has its own taste and aroma. And the main thing here is 
            to fry all the products in a way so that they complement each other and not interrupt 
            the taste. For this purpose it is best to fry potatoes, mushrooms and onions separately, 
            then mix and bring to full readiness together. The choice of spices depends on mushrooms 
            you use. White mushrooms and chanterelles have their own delicate flavor and 
            can not stand rich spices. Here it will be enough to season the dish with salt and 
            white ground pepper. Nutmeg is perfect in combination with mushrooms and sour cream. 
            Finished dish is better to sprinkle with fresh herbs, dill, and parsley.

                <li>8-10 potatoes</li>
                <li>2-3 onions</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp butter</li>

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>First you need to prepare the mushrooms. White mushrooms, aspen or birch boletes 
                    should be boiled. Chanterelles and champignons may not be subject to preliminary 
                    heat treatment. Slice the mushrooms not too finely, they lose a lot of water 
                    during frying. Cut potatoes into slices or strips. Cut onion into cubes.</li>
                <li>Fry chopped mushrooms in little heated vegetable oil. Evaporate all the moisture; 
                    add salt when the mushrooms begin to fry. Put them in a separate bowl. 
                    Then fry onions in butter fry until golden brown. Combine onions with mushrooms.</li>
                <li>Fry potatoes until crisp, sprinkle with salt, and then add mushrooms with onions. 
                    Leave for a while on low heat under the lid, add spices.</li>
                <li>Serve the dish with sour cream and rye bread.</li>               
            <ol>
